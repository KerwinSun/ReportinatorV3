ACR-X No Vulnerability Assessment Solution
==========================================

Description
-----------
Azure reports that no vulnerability assessment solution has been installed on one or more systems. A vulnerability assessment solution reports vulnerability and health monitoring to Azure Security Center so that vulnerable virtual machines can be quickly identified.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To see that no vulnerability assessment solution has been enabled, browse to the following location.
* Security Center -> Compute -> Add a vulnerability assessment

Systems Affected
----------------
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Low â€“ Routine vulnerability assessments are important since the threat landscape is always changing with the discovery of new vulnerabilities and the development of new exploits. By not assessing vulnerabilities, some might go unpatched or unremediated. Leaving this feature disabled contravenes the recommendation of the vendor.

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends that a vulnerability assessment tool which is compatible with Azure be configured to perform routine vulnerability assessments of the implementation.
