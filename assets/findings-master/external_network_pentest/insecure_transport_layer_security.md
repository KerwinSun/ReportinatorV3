ENP-4 Insecure Transport Layer Security
=======================================

Description
-----------
The implementation is using weak cryptographic protocols to secure communication. Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols are cryptographic protocols designed to secure the communication between networked computers. All versions of SSL and some versions of TLS are known to be insecure. Some ciphers accepted by the servers to secure these protocols are weak and known to be insecure.
Some servers are accepting SSLv3 connections. SSLv3 has vulnerabilities. These include:
  * BEAST (CVE-2011-3389) - a man-in-the-middle attack of TLSv1.0 and SSL can be performed on some CBC mode ciphers in order to expose the plaintext of a communication
  * POODLE (CVE-2014-3566) - an attack on the SSLv3 padding which allows the calculation of the plaintext of a communication
The servers are accepting ciphers with known weaknesses. These include:
  * RC4-based ciphers - RC4 has biases in its cipherstream which an attacker can use to recover the plaintext of a communication
  * MD5-based ciphers - MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks
    * http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/170.pdf
  * SHA1-based ciphers - SHA-1 is vulnerable to collision attacks
    * https://shattered.io/
  * 3DES-based ciphers – 3DES uses a 64-bit block size, which is vulnerable to a birthday attack known as SWEET32.

Some servers have self-signed certificates which are expired. Self-signed certificates have not been signed by a trusted authority. Self-signed certificates prevent users from detecting man-in-the-middle attacks. If a certificate is expired, it is not possible to detect its revocation status. Some of these certificates do not seem to reflect the hostname of the hosts to which they are assigned.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To see that some servers use weak protocols and ciphers, use a command line tool, such as sslscan, to query the web server for supported cryptographic protocols and ciphers. However, this finding was discovered through a Nessus scan.
```
sslscan --nofailed <IP>
```

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***See Appendix B***

Severity
--------
Medium – Were an attacker able to successfully exploit these weaknesses, sensitive data might be captured and exfiltrated. The organisation could suffer reputational damage from malicious use or leaks of this data.

Recommendation
--------------
Configure the servers to secure communication using TLSv1.2 and modern ciphers with no known weaknesses. Disable compression and have a trusted certificate authority sign all tickets. More information about securing web communication can be found at the following location:

The widespread use of TLS v1.3 is imminent. Web browsers, which support it, have already been released to the public. How the implementation could accommodate this new protocol should be considered.
