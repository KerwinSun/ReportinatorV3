ADR-X Unsupported Operating Systems
===================================

Description
-----------
Some hosts in the directory use an operating system which is not under active support.

Severity
--------
Critical â€“ Unsupported operating systems will not receive any future security patches, nor have they had any patches since becoming end of life. Windows Server 2003 and XP have been end-of-life since 14/07/2015 and 08/04/2014, respectively. All hosts which are not supported affect the overall security of the organisation.

Recommendation
--------------
Ensure that these hosts are decommissioned as soon as possible. Supported operating systems running unsupported service packs should be upgraded if decommissioning is not likely to occur in the short-term. Unsupported operating systems should be removed from the organisation as soon as possible.
