0365-X Insecure Account Access
==============================

Description
-----------
Some accounts are not configured to use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication requires a user to enter a unique, one-time, authentication code which is generated by an approved device or service along with a password. This is sometimes referred to as "something you know and something you carry," since the password is memorised and the unique code is typically provided by a device.
* 5 global admins do not have MFA configured
* 40 users do not have MFA configured

Medium â€“ Leaving MFA disabled leaves accounts more vulnerable to account compromise and privilege escalation.

This finding indicates a lack of adherence to the following New Zealand Information Security Manual control.
* NZISM 16.1.19. Methods for system user identification and authentication
  * https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document/#1824

This finding indicates a lack of adherence to the following vendor recommendation:
* Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Recommendation
--------------
Ensure that all accounts require MFA for login. After the configuration change has been made, observe the reproduction details to verify that MFA has been enabled for all accounts.
