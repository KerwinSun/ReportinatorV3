O365-X Insufficient Data Loss Prevention
========================================

Description
-----------
Insufficient steps have been taken to prevent data loss from the implementation. The following features in Office 365 have not been enabled.
* Client Rules Forwarding Block has not been enabled.
* Information Rights Management (IRM) is not used.

Client Rules Forwarding Block prevents users from setting rules which automatically forward emails to address outside the organisation.

IRM helps prevent data loss via email by controlling who can access data stores in emails.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To see that Client Rules Forwarding Block and IRM have ot been enabled, visit the following link.

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ Data from email communications might be exfiltrated through automatic forwarding rules. Without classifying data through IRM, all rights management will be managed by human actions.

This finding indicates a lack of adherence to the following New Zealand Information Security Manual control.
* NZISM 15.2.10. Automatic forwarding of emails
  * https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document/#1734
* NZISM 22.1.24. Unauthorised Access
  * https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#4760

Recommendation
--------------
Consider enabling Client Rules Forwarding Block and IRM in the Office 365 configuration.
