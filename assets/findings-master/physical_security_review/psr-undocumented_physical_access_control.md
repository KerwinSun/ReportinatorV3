PSR-X Undocumented Physical Access Control
==========================================

Description
-----------
The design does not sufficiently document the physical access control systems to the facility. Access control systems include a combination of psychological barriers, the presence of security staff at entry/exit points, surveillance equipment, locks, and multi-factor identity validation (authentication). Multi-factor authentication can include some combination of something known by personnel (PINs, codes, etc.), something carried by personnel (cards, keys, etc.), and/or biometric recognition (face, fingerprint, etc.).

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ Without sufficient documentation, it is impossible to determine whether security requirements have been met.

This issue indicates a lack of adherence to NZISM:
  * 8.1.9 Facility physical security

NZISM 8.1.9 refers to the PSR (Protective Security Requirements).
  * PHYSEC1 states "agencies must provide clear direction on physical security through the development and implementation of an agency physical security policy, and address agency physical security requirements as part of the overall agency security plan."

Recommendation
--------------
Refer to the PSR. Physical Security Management Protocol, Security Zones and Risk Mitigation Control Measures, Section 4.5 includes information on access control. The documentation should include the physical security requirements for the facility, how those requirements were determined, and the specific measures taken to meet those requirements.
