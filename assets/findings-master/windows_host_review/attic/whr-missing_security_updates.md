To see the frequency of patching, issue the following command.
```
get-hotfix
```

Systems Affected
----------------
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
High â€“ The missing patches include fixes for vulnerabilities, remote code execution and privilege escalation. Were an attacker to successfully exploit the vulnerabilities, the host would be compromised. The host could then be used as a platform to launch other attacks within the environment.

This finding indicates a lack of adherence to:

*  NZISM 12.4.4.

Recommendation	
--------------
Ensure that the host is patched and that a patching policy clearly delegates patch release monitoring and patch application responsibility. All critical vulnerabilities should be patched within 48 hours of their publication. Perform regular audits of these processes.
