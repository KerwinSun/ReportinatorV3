WHR-X Insufficient HID and Anti-malware
=======================================

Description
-----------
The malware definitions of the native windows anti-malware software are outdated. The server will not be protected against newer malware or newer variants of malware.

A full scan has never been performed.

There was no additional host-based intrusion detection software (IDS) installed. Host-based IDS monitors the integrity of system objects such as critical system or application files, identifies changes to those objects and generates an alert or report for investigation.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To see the anti-malware status, issue the following command.

```
get-mpcomputerstatus
```

Systems Affected
----------------
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ Insufficient protection from malware has been configured, so infections might go undetected and unquarantined. There is no mechanism for identifying changes to critical system files or other system objects. As a result, a malicious user or attacker could make changes to the system without detection.

This finding indicates a lack of adherence to:

* NZISM 14.1. Standard Operating Environments

Recommendation
--------------
The standard antivirus product of the organisation should be configured to run on-access scans and regular full scans of the file system. Ensure that the Antivirus solution receives definition updates daily, and that alerts are logged centrally and actioned appropriately. A failure to update definitions or other anti-malware failure should trigger an alert and be investigated. In addition, Lateral Security recommends the use of host IDS software to monitor critical system and application files and report any unauthorised changes to these files.
