The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
High â€“ ***The reviewed systems might be vulnerable to remote code execution and privilege escalation.*** Were an attacker to successfully exploit an unpatched system, the system could be compromised. This could lead to a compromise of the underlying infrastructure and the system environment.
