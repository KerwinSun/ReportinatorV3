ACR-X No MFA on Root Account
============================

Description
-----------
The VPC root account is not configured to use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication requires a user to enter a unique, one-time, authentication code which is generated by an approved device or service along with a password. This is sometimes referred to as "something you know and something you carry," since the password is memorised and the unique code is typically provided by a device.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Issue the following command.

    aws iam get-account-summary | grep "AccountMFAEnabled"

This is set to 0.

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ This does not represent a vulnerability in the configuration. However, leaving it disabled leaves the root account more vulnerable to compromise. The root account is unrestricted, and could be used by an attacker to delete resources or exfiltrate sensitive data. High costs could also result from an attacker using an excessive amount of AWS resources.

The following CIS benchmark recommendation has not been followed:
  * 1.13 Ensure MFA is enabled for the "root" account

Recommendation
--------------
Configure multifactor authentication for the root account user. More information on this can be found at the link below:
