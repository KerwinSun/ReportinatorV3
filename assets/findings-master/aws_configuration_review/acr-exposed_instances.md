Severity
--------
Low â€“ Instances often contain sensitive data, so are kept on private networks behind firewalls and NACLs. If these instances were misconfigured to allow an attacker to gain access to their data, or if a vulnerability were found in the services, then sensitive data might be disclosed or altered.

Recommendation
--------------
Put the instances on a secured, private network and only allow access to approved clients with security groups and NACLs.
