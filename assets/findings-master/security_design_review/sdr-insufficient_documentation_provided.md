DR-X Insufficient Documentation Provided
=============================================

Description
-----------
The documentation supplied provides insufficient detail regarding the security requirements of the environment and the security controls designed to meet those requirements.

The documentation provided does not provide the necessary information to “ensure the stated security objectives and risks are appropriately managed, and to identify any gaps in the technical design" which is the objective of this review.

Severity
--------
High – A lack of documentation regarding the organisation and the environment's security requirements and how those requirements will be met is likely to lead to decisions with a security impact being made in an ad-hoc manner, increasing the likelihood of compromise and the loss or unauthorised disclosure of information

Recommendation
--------------
The solution design should be more thoroughly defined, especially with regards to security risks and mitigations. Lateral Security recommends following the recommendations of the most recent version of the New Zealand Information Security Manual, which is produced by the Government Communications Security Bureau. When solving the problems detailed by the design, the topics covered in the manual should be addressed as part of the documented solutions.
