DR-X Key or Certificate Management Undefined
=============================================

Description
-----------
The management of cryptographic keys and certificates was not defined in the documentation. Key management is important as the private keys and certificates are used to encrypt the data throughout an environment. If keys are not appropriately provisioned, stored and destroyed, an attacker may be able to decrypt and intercept network traffic. If perfect forward secrecy is not in use, this would allow an attacker to retroactively decrypt previously captured traffic.

Severity
--------
Low â€“ Without appropriate key management in place, an attacker may be able to obtain the private keys in use throughout the environment and obtain access to sensitive traffic.

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends all key management practices are defined in accordance with NZISM 17.9. This should include the provisioning and generation of keys, as well as the storage and the destruction of them. 
The policy should also define policies regarding key revocation, rotation frequency, backups, etc.
