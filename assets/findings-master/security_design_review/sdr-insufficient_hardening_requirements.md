DR-X Insufficient Hardening Requirements
=============================================

Description
-----------
No industry standard hardening guides are required or referenced by the design. Hardening guides include security manuals, security benchmarks, security technical implementation guides, and vendor documentation.

Reference
---------
***Which section of which document are we referring to?***


Severity
--------
Medium â€“ Hardening guides are an important part of securing an implementation. These guides often contain knowledge which has come from years of experience, testing, and many environments. If the recommendations of these guides are not followed, common security vulnerabilities might be introduced to the implementation. Recommended standards are not being followed.
This finding indicates a lack of adherence to:
-	NZISM 5.5. Standard Operating Procedures
-	NZISM 14.1. Standard Operating Environments


Recommendation
--------------
Ensure that hardening guides are referenced in documentation and required for all implementations. Hardening should take place before testing to ensure that the expected functionality remains.
