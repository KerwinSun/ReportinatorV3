DR-X NZISM Considerations Omitted
=============================================

Description
-----------
It is expected that the solution will require compliance with the New Zealand Information Security Manual (NZISM), however it was noted that no reference to this document is made in the provided documentation. If security requirements are not mapped to NZISM standards and these standards incorporated into the design, it could be difficult to ensure that the solution will be aligned with this standard.
Lateral Security was not provided with the following types of documents as defined in the NZISM (section 5.1.5):
* Information Security Policy
* Systems Architecture
* Security Risk Management Plan
* System Security Plan
* Site Security Plan
* Standard Operating Procedures
* Incident Response Plan
* Emergency Procedures

Reference
---------
***Which section of which document are we referring to?***


Severity
--------
Medium â€“ If the security guidance provided by NZISM is not used within the design process, this may cause significant issues in the future which may delay the solution certification.


Recommendation
--------------
Ensure the solution has been designed to meet the security standards set by NZISM to ensure it is appropriately configured and architected for the intended certification.
