SDR-X Undocumented Physical Access Control
==========================================

Description
-----------
The design does not document the physical access control systems protecting the implementation. Access control systems include a combination of psychological barriers, the presence of security staff at entry/exit points, surveillance equipment, locks, and multi-factor identity validation (authentication). Multi-factor authentication can include some combination of something known by personnel (PINs, codes, etc.), something carried by personnel (cards, keys, etc.), and/or biometric recognition (face, fingerprint, etc.).

Severity
--------
Info â€“ Without sufficient documentation, it is impossible to determine whether security requirements have been met. Lateral Security understands that physical access control might be outside the scope of the review. However, this finding is being raised for completeness.

Recommendation
--------------
The documentation should include the physical security requirements for the facility housing the implementation, how those requirements were determined, and the specific measures taken to meet those requirements.
