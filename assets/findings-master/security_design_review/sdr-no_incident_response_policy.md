Reference
---------
***Which section of which document are we referring to?***


Severity
--------
Low â€“ A lack of emergency policy and contact details could make response to an attack or disaster more difficult to respond to and might lead to longer downtimes or further penetration into the solution.

Recommendation
--------------
Incident response policy should include:
* emergency contact details (incident authority)
* definition of an incident
* short-term response instructions until the incident authority can be reached
* how to safeguard evidence of the incident
* how to formally report incidents
