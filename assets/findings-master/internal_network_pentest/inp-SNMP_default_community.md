INP-X SNMP With Default Community Strings
===============================

Description
-----------
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a UDP based service which typically provides diagnostic information and sometimes offers the ability to reconfigure device parameters. This protocol is unencrypted and for most versions (v1, v2c), relies solely on the consumer knowing the configured “community string” of the device. This string is most commonly the value “public” or “private” although some vendors use their own default values.
**Remove this if the issue only relates to one system:** Lateral Security identified that SNMP was available on multiple hosts within the networked environment.

This can sometimes be used for reflected denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which are achieved by sending a small request to the server which results in a large response back.
If an attacker impersonates a targeted system when sending this small packet, then the SNMP will send the larger packet to the victim, consuming network resources.

Information disclosed by the service can often be of benefit to an attacker, potentially including:
* Routing rules.
* Additional networking interfaces.
* Running services (including run flags).


Reproduction Details
--------------------
To identify hosts running SNMP, conduct a network scan for UDP port 161.
```
nmap -sU -p 161 –script snmp-info <host>
```
Individual instances can be confirmed using snmpwalk or other tools from the net-snmp package.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * *** SYSTEM - Indicate if GETBULK/DoS is supported or if any interesting info is disclosed ***

Severity
--------
Low – An attacker can leverage SNMP access to gain information about the running device. This often includes software versions, active processes, or active network connections. In some cases, it may permit the reconfiguration of the device.


Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends reviewing whether the identified hosts require SNMP to be enabled, disabling it where deemed unnecessary or restricting access to only required hosts via firewall rules when it is required. 

It is suggested to change the community string used by the devices; however, this is not considered to be a robust security control. 
SNMPv3 permits the use of authentication prior to accepting request; however, many devices do not support this revision.
