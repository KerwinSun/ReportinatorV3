INP-X Insecure Device Failover
==============================

Description
-----------
At least one network device is configured for failover through the use of the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) with the default, plain text password. This password is sent insecurely across the network. An implementation uses HSRP to meet high availability requirements. Two or more network devices can share a virtual IP address. This IP address acts as the router for a given network, and should one device fail, that IP address is automatically acquired by one of the remaining network devices which will then act as the router.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a tool, such as Wireshark, to passively listen to all packets on the link for about a minute. To ease reading, you can filter the capture so that only HSRP packets are shown.
Click on the HSRP packet. Expand the tree of "Cisco Hot Standby Router Protocol" so that it can be read.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
High â€“ With this information, the platform of an attacker could be configured to act as the router in order to launch a denial of service or a man-in-the-middle attack on the network by pre-empting the HSRP election process.
The existence of HSRP communication indicates a lack of adherence to NZISM v2.4 18.1.13.C.01, which states that agencies should implement protection measures to minimise the risk of unauthorised access to network management traffic on a network.

Recommendation
--------------
If the solution does not require high availability and does not have device redundancy on the network, then disable HSRP on the device. Otherwise, change the HSRP password and configure HSRP to use hash authentication instead of plain text. Other hardening should be configured on the device, if it has not already been done. Cisco provide a guide to hardening Cisco devices.
