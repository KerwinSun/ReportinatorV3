INP-X Insecure Name Resolution
==============================

Description
-----------
At least one device is configured to broadcast Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) packets, a multicast name resolution protocol which is used by Windows hosts. LLMNR is the successor to NBT-NS.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a tool, such as Wireshark, to passively listen to all packets on the link for about a minute. To ease reading, you can filter the capture so that only LLMNR packets are shown.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Info â€“ A host configured to use LLMNR for name resolution might be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. The host will query all hosts on the network for names which it cannot resolve through other means. An attacker could wait for these queries, reply that their platform is the sought host, and then request credentials from the victim. The attack is mitigated by the requirement that the credentials must then be cracked by the attacker.

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends that multicast name resolution be disabled in group policy on all hosts which are part of the implementation.
