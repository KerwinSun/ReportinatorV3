INP-X Weak Passwords in Use
===========================

Description
-----------
Lateral Security identified multiple weak passwords in use on domain accounts in the internal environment.
Although these passwords meet the minimum requirements of the current password settings, they are still considered insufficiently strong and are likely to be guessed by an attacker. If guessed, an attacker would be granted domain level user access.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To reproduce this issue:
  * ***XYZ***

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Critical – These passwords were discovered after breaching the domain admin account and downloading the NTDS database where Windows credentials are saved in an encrypted format for Active Directory Domains. These encrypted credentials were subjected to a dictionary-based attack that leverages passwords from publicly disclosed data breaches. ***200*** accounts in total were compromised as a result of this effort.

Many of the passwords breached consisted of commonly known passwords such as “Password123, Welcome123, Tuesday17 etc”.
While it is likely that a brute-force attack conducted on the network would result in account lockout or a similar control being triggered, tools demonstrated during testing allowed the obtained credentials to be compromised offline by means of a dictionary-based attack without triggering lockout of accounts.

Once credentials are revealed an attacker can return to make a login attempt or target internet facing services such as mail servers and VPN connections.

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommend that DNS zone transfer be limited to only servers that need this information.
