INP-X Outdated Software and Systems
=================================

Description
-----------
Patching is number one on CERT NZ's list of Critical Controls for mitigation against published/known vulnerabilities.
During testing, Lateral Security identified:
* Outdated services/daemons.
* Outdated hardware/firmware.
* Outdated operating systems.

These systems were correlated to versions containing published vulnerabilities, but exploitation was not attempted due to the potential impact on the hosts.

It is noted that mitigating factors (unmet attack prerequisites, configuration requirements, backported patches, etc) may limit the exploitability of these issues.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Software and system versions were enumerated using various fingerprinting methods, these included:
* Automated scanning.
* Application banners.
* Web-based disclosures (headers, content, comments).

This identified:
* ***LIST VULNS***

Additional outdated systems may also be present within the environment and internal investigation is suggested for completeness of findings.


Systems Affected
----------------
The following hosts are affected by this issue:
  * ***SITE***

Severity
--------
High â€“ Patching is number one on CERT NZ's Critical Controls, as compromise through outdated technologies is a major cause of security incidents.
The identified versions contain published vulnerabilities, potentially leading to:
* ***Example Impacts***

A lack of patching processes is likely to result in other systems remaining vulnerable if future security exploits are identified.


Recommendation
--------------

Lateral Security recommends updating the identified systems to the latest available versions.
If no patch is available, consider disabling the service or isolating (network segmentation) the host.

Internal version auditing should be conducted, leveraging administrative access to gain greater visibility of product versions.

A patching policy and process should be established to ensure systems continue to be maintained. Guidance for these processes can be found at:
