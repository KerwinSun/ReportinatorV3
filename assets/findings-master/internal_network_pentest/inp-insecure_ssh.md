INP-X Insecure SSH
==================

Description
-----------
SSH uses the weak cryptographic algorithms, CBC and SHA-1. CBC, cipher block chaining, is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.

SHA-1, a hash function, is probably vulnerable to collision attacks.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a tool, such as Nessus, to scan the internal network for vulnerabilities. The report will indicate that some hosts and devices are using weak cryptographic algorithms.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ Exploitation of the cryptographic weaknesses is possible. Disclosure of sensitive information, including login credentials, might be obtained. However, the difficulty and time required for the exploitation make other attacks more attractive.

This issue indicates a lack of adherence to NZISM:
  * 17.2.10. SHA-1, 3DES, DH, DSA and RSA MUST NOT be used for new implementations but are approved only for current legacy systems already running these algorithms. It is important to note that the use of these older cryptographic algorithms has been deprecated in several countries including Australia and the US. 
  * 17.2.24. Using the Advanced Encryption Standard

Recommendation
--------------
The possible configurations for SSH will depend on the versions running on the host or device. The most modern cryptographic algorithms should be used in the configuration and all weak ones should be disabled.
