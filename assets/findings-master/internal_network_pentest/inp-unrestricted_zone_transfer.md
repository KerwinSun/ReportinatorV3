INP-X Unrestricted Zone Transfer
================================

Description
-----------
Domain controllers of the following domains allow unrestricted DNS zone transfer:
  * XYZ
  * XYZ

A zone transfer is used to copy the contents of the zone file from one DNS server to another DNS server, exposing information about the domains the DNS server is managing. Access to this information should be restricted to other DNS servers which are legitimately expected to request the information.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Low â€“ A zone transfer enables an attacker to instantly populate a list of potential targets. In addition, companies often use a naming convention that can give hints as to a primary application (for instance, proxy.example.com, payroll.example.com, swift1.example.com, etc.).
***Note that the vulnerable domain controllers are not on the primary domain "XYZ" and do not contain useful additional information to attackers. Therefore, this issue has been assigned a severity rating of Low.***

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommend that DNS zone transfer be limited to only servers that need this information.
