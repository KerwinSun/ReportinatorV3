INP-X IPMI v2.0 Support
===============================

Description
-----------
IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a protocol used to remotely monitor and manage server hardware; 
providing access to CPU, firmware, and operating system data.

This service supports a cryptographic protocol (RAKP) which involves sending hashed versions of passwords to remote users.
These hashes can then be used in offline brute-force attacks to determine the original value used to create the hash.


Reproduction Details
--------------------
This vulnerability was enumerated using the automated scanning tool "nessus", but it can also be validating using "nmap":
```
nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 {TARGET_IP}
```


Systems Affected
----------------
  * ***SITE***


  Severity
--------
High â€“ This vulnerability allows attackers to attempt offline brute-force attacks to determine credentials for the IPMI service.
Once compromised, the attacker will have the equivalent permissions as a user with physical access to the host.


Recommendation
--------------

Lateral Security recommends either disabling the service if it is not required, 
alternatively isolating it through network segmentation and separation if it fulfils a business requirement.

A strong password is suggested to increase the effort required for brute-force attacks as part of a defense-in-depth security strategy.
This vulnerability is the result of the IPMI specification and cannot be patched out.
