INP-X SMBv1.0 Supported
===============================

Description
-----------
Server Message Block (SMB) is a network protocol used primarily to access shared files and printers. 
Modern versions of this protocol have no known vulnerabilities when configured in line with good practice, however ***Organisation's*** configuration deviates from this configuration by supporting SMBv1.0.


Reproduction Details
--------------------
Determine whether a particular host exposes SMBv1 using the nmap script below:
```
nmap --script smb-protocols -p 139,445 <host>
```

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Critical â€“ Support for SMBv1 was a key factor in vulnerability to the ETERNALBLUE exploit and the WannaCry ransomware. While Microsoft released patches for those specific vulnerabilities, the deprecated SMBv1 protocol is considered to be insecure.
It is likely that future vulnerabilities in this protocol version will be identified, resulting in arbitrary access to shared files or even remote code execution. Further to this, SMBv1 does not support key security controls which are present in later versions and considered to be requirements in a modern environment.

Recommendation
--------------
Disable support for SMBv1. 
For instructions, see the following URL:

It is also recommended that message signing be enabled and required. 
If continuing to support SMBv1 is required due to environmental limitations, ensure that the impact of this requirement is well understood. Develop a migration plan for reducing the presence of this vulnerable protocol in the environment.
