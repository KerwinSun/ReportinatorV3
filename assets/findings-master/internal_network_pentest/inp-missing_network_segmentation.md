INP-X Missing Network Segmentation
===============================

Description
-----------
Network segmentation and separation is a security control used to isolate sensitive devices from untrusted environments.
It is listed by CERT NZ (cert.govt.nz) as one of the "Ten Critical Controls" to mitigate against common attacks observed within New Zealand organisations.

Lateral Security identified that the organisation's network was predominately flat, allowing users to access various services including:
* Routing Hardware
* Firewalls
* Server Management (IPMI / iLO)
* Telephony Services
* Domain Controllers
* Web Servers
* Mail Servers
* File Shares
* Printers
* User Workstations

This allows an attacker positioned within the network to target any of these systems, moving laterally throughout the environment.


Reproduction Details
--------------------
Scan the environment using a network enumeration tool, such as "nmap" or "nessus" to identify live hosts and exposed services.


Systems Affected
----------------
  * Systemic


  Severity
--------
High â€“ Network segmentation is a critical security control to mitigate against infrastructure-based attacks.
It increases the complexity in exploiting vulnerable systems and reduces the readily available attack surface of the environment.


Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends segmenting networked devices by intended function, progressively implementing separation/segregation while maintaining business continuity.
