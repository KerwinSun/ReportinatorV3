INP-X Insecure Remote Desktop Service
=====================================

Description
-----------
The remote desktop service (RDS) does not require that administrators use Network Level Authentication (NLA) during login. NLA forces a client computer to present credentials for authentication before the server will create a session for the user. Because a full session is not created until this authentication occurs, the likelihood of denial of service is reduced.
The RDS configuration enables the weak cryptographic algorithms, RC4 and MD5, which both contain vulnerabilities which could undermine the confidentiality of the transport.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
 * ***SYSTEMS***
 
Severity
--------
Low â€“The remote desktop service has not been hardened in line with good practice guidelines. Having NLA disabled increases the exposure of the service to attackers and is a violation of the principle of least privilege. 

Recommendation
--------------
Require remote desktop users to use NLA. Disable remote desktop on all hosts which do not require it.

Ensure that clients connect with secure cryptographic algorithms.
