INP-X Exposed Administrative Interfaces
=======================================

Description
-----------
Devices on the wired network have exposed administrative web interfaces, which are reachable from all subnets. At least one device is configured with the default administrative login and password. Some other devices with exposed administrative interfaces include printers and phones.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a program, such as arp-scan, to perform an ARP ping scan on a network link of the solution. The example below would scan the first of the wired subnets.

    arp-scan --interface=eth0 10.0.0.0/24

Look for the IP address of the device with the MAC of 00:00:00:00:00:00. This is a phone. From a web browser, enter that resultant IP in the address bar to view the configuration utility. The default administrative username and password, which has been published on the Internet, can be used to log in to web interface.
Other administrative interfaces for devices on the network can be seen by following a similar process.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
High â€“ Because configuration of the phones can be altered, telecommunication services could be disrupted. Were printers reconfigured maliciously, then printing services could suffer the same consequence. It might be difficult to trace the cause of the disruption. In worse cases, these devices might be used as platforms to launch attacks on the rest of the solution and might help an attacker acquire sensitive information.

This issue indicates a lack of adherence to NZISM:
  * 16.3.5. Use of priviliged accounts
  * 18.3.10. Local area network traffic separation

Recommendation
--------------
Place all devices, which clients will not need to reach directly, on a separate physical network or VLAN. Configure those devices so that their administrative web interfaces are disabled, if not needed. Change the default administrative password for each device.
