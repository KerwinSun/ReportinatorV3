INP-X Unrestricted Outbound Traffic
===================================

Description
-----------
Traffic going from the internal network to the Internet is not restricted by firewall and web proxy. A firewall can be configured to filter traffic to external hosts and ports which are not required by the organisation devices, or to force those devices to access outside web services through a proxy. A proxy can be configured which will enable web traffic to be inspected and controlled at the application layer.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a program, such as curl, to connect to an external website. The command will return the contents of the website.

    curl --no-proxy http://www.webcrawler.com/

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ Sensitive organisational information might be leaked and misuse of organisational resources might occur. It also remains difficult to prevent users from connecting to unsanctioned sites and services.

This issue indicates a lack of adherence to NZISM:
  * 7.1.4. Preventing and detecting information security incidents
  * 14.1.6. Developing hardened SOEs
  * 14.3.6. Web proxy
  * 14.2.12. Web content filter

Recommendation
--------------
Configure the firewall to filter all outbound traffic from the internal network. Install a web proxy which will inspect and restrict access to external web resources based on organisational policies. Configure all client devices to use this web proxy to access external websites.
