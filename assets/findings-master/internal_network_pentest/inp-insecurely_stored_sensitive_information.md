Reproduction Details

Browse to the affected hosts using Windows Explorer.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium – The noted configuration does not appear to align with the principle of least privilege which dictates that a user should have access to only the resources required to accomplish their intended tasks. The current configuration allows access to sensitive files to users who have no reason to access those resources.

A user who plugs in to the network would be able to access the data on this file share and  ***COMPLETE***

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends conducting a thorough review of information sharing practices within the organisation and consider archiving information that is no longer current or required to continue day to day business operations.
Consider appointing information owners that are responsible for managing sensitive information. These users will be responsible for logging access requests to the service desk to either grant or revoke permissions based on a user’s requirement.
