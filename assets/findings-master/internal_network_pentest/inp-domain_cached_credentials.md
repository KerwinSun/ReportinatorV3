INP-X Domain Cached Credentials
===============================

Description
-----------
Throughout the network, Lateral Security identified the registry key 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ Winlogon\CachedLogonsCount' is not 0. Using a value greater than 0 for the CachedLogonsCount key indicates that the remote Windows host locally caches the passwords of the users when they login, in order to continue to allow the users to login in the case of the failure of the primary domain controller (PDC).

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium – Cached logon credentials could be accessed by an attacker and subjected to brute force cracking attempts result in account compromise.

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends setting the registry key: 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\CachedLogonsCount' to a value of ‘0’ with the exception of devices such as laptops used by staff who work off-site frequently or have limited access to the physical network.
