INP-X Insecure Network Management
=================================

Description
-----------
Devices on the network have been configured to use a version of SNMP prior to version 3. These older versions of the protocol are not secure. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 lack cryptographic security which helps to protect the sensitive diagnostic information and management access that SNMP provides. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 use a community string for access control, and this string traverses the network in the clear. The devices are configured to use the default community string.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a tool, such as Wireshark, to passively listen to all packets on the link for about a minute. To ease reading, you can filter the capture so that only SNMP packets are shown. Click on an SNMP packet. Expand the tree of "Simple Network Management Protocol" so that it can be read. The community parameter shows that the string is "public", which is the default.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ By using SNMPv1, the implementation remains vulnerable to traffic sniffing for any attacker who might gain access to the network. The type of information typically provided over SNMP includes that which might help an attacker enumerate hosts, devices, and possibly even acquire passwords.

This issue indicates a lack of adherence to NZISM:
  * 18.1.14. Simple Network Management Protocol

Recommendation
--------------
SNMPv1 should be replaced with SNMPv3 and segregated to a dedicated management network or it should be disabled.
