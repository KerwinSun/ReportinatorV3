INP-X No Port Security
======================

Description
-----------
One shared service is secured by IP filtering. Any device or host on the network may spoof this IP from any switchport and reach that service. This is possible because port security has not been configured on the switches. Port security configures a switchport to only allow a connection from a preregistered MAC address.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Approach one of the devices of the implementation. Use its configuration menu to find its IP address. Unplug that device from the wall jack. Plug a laptop into that same wall jack. Assign the laptop the same IP address that the printer was using.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Low â€“ If any device can access the wired network that the printers are on, then it might be possible for an attacker to reach a vulnerable service.

Recommendation
--------------
Place the hosts and devices which should not be reached by clients on a separate, wired physical subnet or wired VLAN. Filter traffic to and from that subnet. Enable port security. Limit the maximum number of secure MAC addresses to 1. Set the restricted MAC address to that of the approved host or device. Ensure that the host or device will not display its MAC address without user authentication.
