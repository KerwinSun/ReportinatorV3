INP-X Insecure FTP Service
==========================

Description
-----------
The FTP server running on some devices would allow an attacker to connect to a third party host or device and some directories on those same devices have world writable directories. Anyone on the network with access to this service can use the device to store data.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
Use a tool, such as Nessus, to scan the internal network for vulnerabilities.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Low â€“ An attacker could use this vulnerability to enumerate services which, otherwise, would not be reachable due to firewall restrictions. An attacker could use the world writable directories to aid in data exfiltration or to store tools for further penetration.

Recommendation
--------------
Consider disabling FTP on these devices, patching the devices, or configuring them to reject connections from reserved ports and writing from all users.
