INP-X Default Credentials in Use
===============================

Description
-----------
The use of default credentials on devices and services is a security weakness which allows attackers to connect to the affected systems, 
performing actions as the authenticated user-level associated with the credentials (typically administrative).

Management of authentication is included in CERT NZ's top 10 Critical Controls, based on attacks observed within New Zealand organisations.


Reproduction Details
--------------------

Connect to the following hosts using the supplied default credentials:
* *** Add hosts/creds here ***




Systems Affected
----------------
The following hosts are affected by this issue: 
  * ***SITE***

While this list contains the systems observed as having default credentials during testing, 
it should not be considered as a comprehensive credential review for the organisation as a whole.


Severity
--------
Critical/Medium â€“ The access achieved through authenticated access to these systems permits at attacker to:
* Fully compromise hosts.
* Replace device firmware to maintain persistent access to the environment.
* Access sensitive information from the hosts.
* *** Make sure these bullets are correct (obviously) add/remove as required ***


Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends changing default credentials to unique, secure passwords.
These should be stored in a secure location (password manager or similar).

CERT NZ provides guidance for this issue at:
* https://www.cert.govt.nz/it-specialists/critical-controls/manage-authentication/changing-default-credentials/

If passwords are hardcoded (unable to be changed) or key functionality is available without authentication,
then it is recommended to either remove the device/service or isolate it through network segmentation and separation.

Internal confirmation across all devices in the organisation is suggested to cover instances which may have been missed during testing.
