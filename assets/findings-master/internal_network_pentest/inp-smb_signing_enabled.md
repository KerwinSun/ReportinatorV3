INP-X Server Message Block (SMB) Signing Disabled
=================================================

Description
-----------
Lateral Security identified hosts with Server Message Block (SMB) enabled on the network which do not require SMB Signing. SMB Signing is a feature that can be used to digitally sign packets before transmission. Digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Medium – In the event an attacker had physical access to the same local network as target hosts, they could carry out an SMB relay attack in order to gain authenticated access to hosts on the network. The attack works by sniffing the network for SMB authentication packets and then replaying them to target hosts where signing is not required. A successful attack would grant an attacker access to the target hosts with the same privilge as the legitimate client. This could be used to gain access to sensitive data or move laterally throughout a network.

Recommendation
--------------
Lateral Security recommends enforcing message signing in the host's configuration as both an SMB client and server. In Group Policy Management, this can be achieved either through Server Manager > Tools > Group Policy Management, or by running ‘gpmc.msc’ in PowerShell or the Command Prompt. 
Within the policy navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options.
