INP-X Circumventable Jump Host
==============================

Description
-----------
A jump host has been configured for the environment, but is not required for access to most of the hosts in scope. A jump host is a computer which has been secured to manage hosts and devices in a separate security zone from where connections originate, such as an internal network. Jump hosts aide in accountability and monitoring, since they act as a choke point for all access into separate security zones.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To reproduce this issue, log into the firewall. This will allow you to access the jump host and most of the other servers within the scope of the engagement directly from the corporate LAN.

Systems Affected
----------------
The following systems are affected by this issue:
  * ***SYSTEM***

Severity
--------
Low â€“ The lack of a jump host increases the attack surface of the environment from the perspective of an attacker coming from the corporate LAN. This is because more of the environment is visible from the corporate LAN, once authentication to the firewall has occurred. If any of the machines that the jump host is meant to protect has a vulnerability, then that host becomes directly exploitable from the corporate LAN.

Recommendation
--------------
Only allow one server, a secured jump host, to reach the administrative interfaces on hosts which are in a separate security zone. Patch that jump host routinely and ensure that monitoring and logging has been configured.
