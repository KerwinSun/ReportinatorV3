WA-X No Malware Scanning
========================

Description
-----------
Up-to-date Antivirus software is listed within the ASD Top Mitigations strategies for malware delivery and execution prevention.
There appears to be no virus checking on files uploaded through the site, as Lateral Security was able to upload a document containing the Eicar test virus which was then accepted by the system.

Reproduction Details
--------------------
To reproduce this issue:
  * Create an EICAR test file, following the instructions at: https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950
  * Upload the file to the server using the ***WORKFLOW***
  * Observe that the file was not detected or removed as malware
  * ***ETC***

Systems Affected
----------------
The following ***host is/hosts are*** affected by this issue:

Severity
--------
Medium â€“ A lack of antivirus scanning allows attackers to upload known malware files to the server, encouraging other users to download and run the malicious code on their own computer. This may lead to technical impact for users of the system and reputational damage to the organisation.
If the file is targeted at internal staff, then the attacker may be able to gain access to internal resources using this weakness.
Attackers may also upload malicious files to the server to link to from other sites, using the organisation's server as a malware delivery platform against third parties.

Recommendation
--------------
Ensure some form of virus scanning is performed as part of the file upload process. Anti-virus software must be up-to-date and running current virus definitions. If the vendor is not able to invoke anti-virus software as part of the file upload process and the files are not stored in the database, then the server itself should run host based Anti-Virus to remove the malicious files.
