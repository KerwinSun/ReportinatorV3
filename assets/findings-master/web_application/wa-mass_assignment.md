WA-X Mass Assignment Vulnerability
=============

Description
-----------
Mass Assignment (Autobinding) is an access control weakness where malicious users can provide additional fields on object create/update actions, setting attributes beyond that of the application's intended permission model.

This vulnerability is often introduced by application frameworks providing both automatic parameter-to-object mapping (deserialisation), and object-to-database mappings (ORM). 
With these features combined, an attacker can supply malicious parameters which are loaded into templated objects and persisted to the database.
